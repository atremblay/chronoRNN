# chronoRNN

This semester project was part of the [ICLR 2018 Reproducibility Challenge](https://ift6135h18.wordpress.com/project-description-iclr2018-reproducibility-challenge/) where graduate students are asked to reproduce, if possible, the results of published papers. Our team chose to work on "[Can Recurrent Neural Networks Warp Time?](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJcKhk-Ab)"
